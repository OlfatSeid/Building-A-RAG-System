Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model with LlamaIndex
This repository provides a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the LlamaIndex library and LLaMA language models. The RAG architecture enhances a language model's ability to answer questions by retrieving relevant information from a document store, making it particularly suitable for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines a retriever and generator to improve the accuracy of answers to complex or specific queries. This RAG pipeline uses the LlamaIndex library as the retriever and Meta's LLaMA language model as the generator. The retriever fetches relevant context from a document corpus, and the generator uses this information to produce contextually accurate responses.
