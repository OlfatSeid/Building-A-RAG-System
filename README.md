## Overview
This repository provides for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which integrates retrieval-based approaches with generative models.
The system first retrieves relevant documents or information from a knowledge base and then uses a generative model to synthesize a coherent response based on the retrieved information.

## Steps Involved in RAG
- 1.Data Ingestion
- 2.Indexing & Storing
- 3.Retrieval
- 4.Response Synthesis
- 5.Query/Chat Engine

## 1. Data Ingestion
The Data Ingestion phase involves collecting, processing, and preparing the data for storage and retrieval.
It can handle structured and unstructured data sources such as text documents, databases, APIs, or web scraping.

## 2. Indexing & Storing
### Why Indexing?
- Quick Retrieval: Speeding up the process of finding relevant information.
- Enhanced Accuracy: Improves the relevance and quality of information retrieved.
- Scalability: Allows the system to efficiently handle large data volumes.
## 3. Retrieval
The Retrieval component is responsible for fetching the most relevant documents based on a user query.
This step is crucial for the RAG system since the quality of retrieved documents directly affects the generated response.
