## Overview
This repository provides for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which integrates retrieval-based approaches with generative models.
The system first retrieves relevant documents or information from a knowledge base and then uses a generative model to synthesize a coherent response based on the retrieved information.

## Steps Involved in RAG
1. Data Ingestion
2. Indexing & Storing
3. Retrieval
4. Response Synthesis
5. Query/Chat Engine


## 1. Data Ingestion
The Data Ingestion phase involves collecting, processing, and preparing the data for storage and retrieval.
It can handle structured and unstructured data sources such as text documents, databases, APIs, or web scraping.
### Features
Ingests data from multiple formats (PDFs, text files, JSON, etc.).
Data validation and preprocessing steps to ensure quality.
Supports both batch and real-time ingestion.
### Key Tools/Technologies
llamaIndex: Used for loading and reading documents from files

' ```python (from llamaIndex import SimpleDirectoryReader

# Load data from PDF files or directories
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_files=['data/transformers.pdf']).load_data()) ''' '


## 2. Indexing & Storing
### Why Indexing?
- Quick Retrieval: Speeding up the process of finding relevant information.
- Enhanced Accuracy: Improves the relevance and quality of information retrieved.
- Scalability: Allows the system to efficiently handle large data volumes.

### Features
- Creates dense embeddings for documents using a custom embedding model.
- Supports various pre-trained models for embedding generation.
- Efficient embedding handling for large document sets, enabling fast retrieval.

### Key Tools/Technologies
- Custom Embedding Model: Define a custom embedding model using SentenceTransformer for embedding generation. 
- llamaIndex: Utilized to create vector-based indexes for document retrieval.
  from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex

# Create a vector-based index from documents
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents,embed_model=embed_model)

## 3. Retrieval
The Retrieval component is responsible for fetching the most relevant documents based on a user query.
This step is crucial for the RAG system since the quality of retrieved documents directly affects the generated response.
### Features
Supports semantic search using embeddings.
Ranked retrieval using relevance scoring algorithms.
Handles complex queries using Boolean logic, fuzzy matching, and more.

## 4. Response Synthesis
In the Response Synthesis phase, a generative model such as a large language model (LLM) processes the retrieved documents and generates a coherent,
contextually relevant response.
### Features
Retrieval-augmented generation that combines relevant documents with the power of generative models.
Fine-tuned for answering domain-specific queries.
Context-aware and supports conversational AI.
### Key Tools/Technologies
llamaIndex: Used to convert the document index into a retriever for querying.For example:
retriever = index.as_retriever()

# Retrieve documents based on a query
query = "What is self attention?"
results = retriever.retrieve(query)

  
## 5. Query/Chat Engine 
The Query/Chat Engine is the user-facing component that takes queries as input, retrieves relevant information,
and returns a synthesized response. It also supports conversational interactions, maintaining context across multiple turns.
